<!-- 
Default number of seconds the queue is under its minimum share before it will
try to preempt containers to take resources from other queues.
-->
<defaultFairSharePreemptionTimeout>10</defaultFairSharePreemptionTimeout>

<!--
If any queue waits defaultFairSharePreemptionTimeout without receiving 
fairSharePreemptionThreshold*fairShare resources, it is allowed to preempt
containers to take resources from other queues.
